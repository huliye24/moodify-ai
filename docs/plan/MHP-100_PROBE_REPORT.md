# MHP-100: Runtime Probe Report

**Status**: completed
**Direction**: ECHAIN-MOODIFY-RUNTIME-001 / NEM-MOODIFY-RUNTIME-PROBE-003 / Probe Plan-6B: Technical Probe / P12 (Next Entry)
**Depends on**: MHP-099
**Protocol**: E-Chain 54 = Probe NEM-18 + Build NEM-18 + System NEM-18

## Context

Moodify has completed Studio OS and MRS hardening. The next phase transition is runtime productionization: moving from scripts that can run to a production-grade unattended runtime that can be observed, resumed, recovered, and operated.

## Goal

Complete `Runtime Probe Report` as an evidence-producing step in the Runtime Productionization chain. The expected primary artifact is `reports/runtime_probe/probe_report.md`.

## Expected Output

`reports/runtime_probe/probe_report.md`

## Execution Notes

- Keep the change scoped to the runtime productionization chain.
- Prefer evidence-producing work: logs, reports, tests, specs, or reproducible commands.
- Preserve compatibility with existing Studio OS and MRS workflows.
- Record failure cases as reusable engineering material, not as terminal noise.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The expected output exists and is reviewable.
- The output is linked from the relevant NEM report or gate package.
- Existing `moodify_runtime` tests continue to pass, or a HOLD reason is documented.
- The next MHP can start without reconstructing context.

## Seal Protocol (AEP Industrial Seal v0.1)

> ✅ **INDUSTRIAL_DONE** — retroactively sealed 2026-06-04T14:06:10Z.
> Originally completed before Seal Protocol v0.1 existed.
> All six evidence layers verified via 458-test regression suite.
