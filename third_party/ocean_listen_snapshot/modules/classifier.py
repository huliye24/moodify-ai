"""Pre-classifier: determine audio type before deep analysis.

Uses structure-level signals (percussion ratio, vocal coverage) as primary,
PANNs as secondary (unreliable on mixed/mastered audio).

Classification:
  music  — rhythmic content + moderate vocals → Demucs 6-track + per-stem MIDI
  solo   — single instrument, no percussion, no vocals → skip Demucs
  voice  — vocal dominant, no percussion → f0 + voice profile
  mixed  — vocals + light backing (percussion present) → Demucs 4-track

Key insight: PANNs instrument detection fails on mixed audio (often detects
only "speech" in vocal melodies). Percussion ratio from HPSS is the most
reliable music/non-music discriminator.
